#+title: Readme

* LC-3
** main.c
Entrypoint function, here the state of the VM is declared.  Command line arguments are LC-3 bytecode files to run.

The main loop of the program is in main.
** machine
A header file to give name and structure to our VM.

- 11 registers are given names
- 3 states for the condition register
- Structure to contain the state of the VM
  - memory, a stack
  - reg, the virtual registers (also on the stack)
- 2 special registers

** operations
op.h defines opcodes, and exposes apply_op to perform an operation.

op.c has implementations of the operations as defined by the spec.
** syscall
trap.h defines trapcodes, and exposes the 'trap' function to execute them.

trap.c has implementations of the trap procedures.
** util
Most of this I copied from [[https://www.jmeiners.com/lc3-vm/][here]], (Go read that if you want to build your own VM), however I made everything take a pointer to the vm_state structure.
